👀 I'm interested in programming of all types from Low Level to Web Security to Networking to Data Analysis to Software Developing and many, many more subjects. \

I am currently on my third year of [Maghsimim](https://www.instagram.com/magshimim_cyber/?hl=en) building an Operating System called WinDoS which centers around making sending packets and communicating online accessible and educational.
